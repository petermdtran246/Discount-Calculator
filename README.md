# Discount Calculator
## Algorithm
1. Prompt the user to enter their bill amount.
2. Read the user input into the amount variable.
3. If the amount is greater than or equal to 5000, calculate the discounted amount by subtracting 20% of the amount from the amount itself.
4. If the amount is between 2000 and 5000 (inclusive), calculate the discounted amount by subtracting 10% of the amount from the amount itself.
5. If the amount is less than 2000, calculate the discounted amount by subtracting 5% of the amount from the amount itself.
6. Print the discounted amount to the console.
